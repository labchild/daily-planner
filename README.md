## About the Project
A calendar web app to keep track of tasks and events happening that day.

### Key Features
* Work day is separated into hour blocks based on typical working hours.
* Hour blocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* Saved tasks are persistent, using local storage, so you can easily close and reload page whenever (on the same browser), without losing that day's tasks.
* Schedule resets to blank tasks each day, so you can start fresh every morning!

### Built With
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
